  Seriously, it is deadly important to make sure the parties signing the contract are the parties who will provide or accept/pay for the services, goods, or whatever (or, if not, that the contract clearly spells out the relationships).  This includes not only the preamble but, more importantly, the signature block.  This is particularly important when one party ends up in a potential bankruptcy situation or there is trouble and litigation is brewing – when having the right parties on the hook really matters.  If there is doubt about the stability of a party to a contract, you can seek a personal guarantee or have a related company guarantee performance of their subsidiary or sister company.  And, regarding signatures, start thinking about who in your company is authorized to sign the contract you are reviewing.  As mentioned above, sometimes there are delegations of authority or other policies that dictate who can sign what.  You don’t want to be minutes away from signing and then realize you don’t have the right person engaged to sign it.

10.  Other tips.  Here are some other things to watch out for as you read through a contract:

Whenever you see the phrase “provided, however” or “provided,” this flags that you are about to read an exception to the contract rule you just finished reading.
If you see a phrase “notwithstanding the foregoing” or “notwithstanding any provision to the contrary,” this flags that you are about to read a rule that trumps all other contract rules on that topic.
The phrase “for the avoidance of doubt,” means the contract author really, really, really wants to make sure there is absolutely and emphatically no confusion on whatever comes next.
Watch out for double negatives! Sometimes it helps to diagram these to make sure you understand exactly what the contract says.  Ultimately, you may want to rewrite the sentence with the double negative so the meaning is clear.
If you think a sentence is ambiguous, ask yourself whether that ambiguity helps the company or hurts the company. If it hurts the company, ask yourself whether you have the leverage to clarify it in negotiations. If not, don’t raise the issue in negotiations because, if you do, it will only get clarified against you.
Contract sentences can be long. Dreadfully long.  So, mark the logical breaks in long sentences, and work section-by-section. Then put the sentence back together as you read back through it.
